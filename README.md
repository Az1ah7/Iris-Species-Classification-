## Iris-Species-Classification-
##### This repository contains code for classifying iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory examples due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Dataset
##### The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is included in many machine learning libraries. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify each sample into one of three species based on these features.

## Model
##### I implemented a classification model using a  Sequential API in Keras. The model is trained on the iris dataset to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.
